<br>

After acquiring an extensive experience in M&A Investment Banking and Corporate Finance Advisory working in top tier Investment Banks I realised that I don't really want to do banking for the rest of my life, and started a long journey towards the job of my dreams. During this journey, while working in various extremely exiting art-related projects, I couldn't resist my growing passion to apply my strong analytical skills to coding. Therefore I came back to where I started (taking into account my Computer Science education).

First sign of my destiny was when shortly after quitting my banking job, I had an irresistable desire to reread Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie C Programming Language Book. Since then I carefully tried to cover different areas of development that are currently on the market:
 - First, I studied Graphic Design and Web Development in Open Design School (and was so into all of this, so that graduated with special honors);
 - Then I went through enormous amount of online courses (TreeHouse: iOS dev, Swift, HTML, CSS, PhP and JavaScript; CodeAcademy; Coursera (Big Data and R);
 - And thereafter I approached website creation on my own, working on misc websites for my friends.

By that time it was obvious that Web is something I am really passioned about, so that is how the idea to make it my career came to me.

The last but not the least was my decision to commit to Makers Academy Immersive Web Development course. I see it as the last step to my future career of my dreams.

Looking forward to creative and analytically challenging work in a company with love towards human beings.

> ## Interests

I am generally interested in everything interesting. Love to find out what other people do, and get broad understanding of the wide scope of everything exciting (arts, science, religions, philosophy and new technologies).

Other than that am completely addicted to yoga.
