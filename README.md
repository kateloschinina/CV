 ***I am an enthusiastic and creative software engineer experienced in building continuously deployed large scale distributed web applications with high demands for security and performance, developing APIs and microservices and engineering data pipelines. I am passionate about JavaScript, learning new languages and frameworks and constantly improving the quality of the code base. I thrive in a lean agile environment.***

 After completing a degree in **Applied Mathematics and Computer Science**, and spending some years in **Investment Banking** and then **Arts**, I came back to tech through **Makers Academy**, where I grasped thorough knowledge of the best practices, Test Driven Development, pair programming and good taste for code. For the last **3.5 years** I’ve been gaining misc software engineering experience in various teams of **the Financial Times**, working on the **award-winning website and one of the fastest news sites in the world**.

> ## Experience

<br>

### Financial Times
**(Apr 2017 - now)**
***Full Stack - Senior Software Engineer***

**FT Apps** - ***Financial Times' mobile application***
 - Being a 10 years old codebase, the apps have lots of legacy code and tech debt. Katerina initiated, negotiated with the product and took leadership over the tech debt initiative whose goal is to improve maintainability, reliability of the codebase and developer experience. The initiative resulted in tackling > 20 major tech debt issues, including breaches in security, replacing with the appropriate alternatives or rebuilding dependencies on non-maintained packages, migrating components to preact, and 4x increase in test coverage.
 - Additionally, as part of general team responsibilities, Katerina maintained old and developed new components and features for the app (a JavaScript web-app partially migrated to preact, with iOSand Android wrappers, PHP API layer, using Jenkins, AWS lambdas, Firebase etc.). 

**Scout Asia** - ***subscription service delivering news and financial overviews Asian companies (JV start-up by FT and Nikkei)***
 - ScoutAsia relies on the data pipeline to provide accurate and timely insights to users, and its performance was starting to affect the quality of the experience. Katerina investigated the source of these issues and implemented a parallelisation solution that significantly reduced pipeline time.
 - Addressing a business need to add information about key employees, Katerina took part in architecting a new “peoples” ETL data pipeline.
 - In addition, Katerina maintained React/Redux/Typescript frontends and improved their Webpack and Circle CI configurations.

**MyFT** - ***personalised ft.com***
 - The MyFT Daily Digest emails were all sent at the same hour, which created a disproportionate load to all systems. Katerina architected a personalisation mechanism that was adjusting send times based on when the user usually opens the email. While doing that Katerina improved the running time of the Daily Digest pipeline from 36 hours to c.20 minutes.
 - Katerina created a Python API layer for a Machine Learning initiative that was exploring personalisation of topics recommended to users.

**B2B Enterprise Tools** - ***a platform for the Financial Times' corporate clients***
 - Created, deployed and incorporated into ft.com micro-services system a suite of applications allowing corporate FT clients to manage their content licenses.
 - Developed 2/5 core apps for the service with server-side rendered React and core experience.
 - Built a pipeline optimising the breakdown of the license usage per user for further analytics.

**Other**
 - Actively participated in recruitment and hiring, including acting as a hiring manager for ScoutAsia (with two successful hires), leading both technical and soft skills interviews.
 - Created [roles.ft.com](). Advocated for the FT at career fairs and conferences.
 - Winner of the prize for the best reader engagement idea at FT hackathon.
 - Line manager.

> ## Tech-related Projects

<br>

### The Ear of the Universe

A multi-sensory, participatory generative art installation; visual-musical instrument that responds to touch with sound and light patterns; created by a team of London-based professionals, where Katerina is a leader and a JavaScript dev.

 - JavaScript, Arduino, Raspberry Pi, Python 
 - The project was showcased internationally and received funding from several Burning Man community events.
 - Katerina gave a [technical conference talk on the topic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbGj-y5Zr18) (at DevFest Siberia, in November 2019).

### Recruitment microsite for the Financial Times

The Product and Tech recruitment microsite for prospective candidates to learn about the FT's culture and apply for current or future vacancies, [roles.ft.com](http://roles.ft.com/)
 - A very simple HTML/CSS website hosted on Netlify (that provides backend for the contact form).
 - The challenge was to try not to use JavaScript at all. It almost worked - the only time the JavaScript is used is to check the size of the uploaded CV.

### Website for the artist Kira Zhigalina

[dotkira.com](https://dotkira.com/)

The idea was to build a very simple website in a way so that the artist herself with no coding knowledge at all could change the descriptions and add new projects. There was a need to address artists requirements for a very unique design, that would represent artistic soul and a vision of their portfolio.
 - After some consideration I decided to show the artist products of vis.js React library. She really liked the idea of interconnected nodes.
 - Created a JSON based very basic CMS and explained the artist how to apply change to the JSON files on GitHub.
