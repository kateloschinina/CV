 ***I am a full stack junior web developer, with experience in Ruby, JavaScript, Rails, TDD, OOD and Front End, looking forward to find a creative and analytically challenging work in an agile-style company.***

 After I have received a strong technical background studying **Computer Science and Applied Mathematics** and then acquired an extensive corporate and project management experience in **M&A Investment Banking**, I started a journey towards the job of my dreams. During this journey, while working in various **art-related projects**, I couldn't resist my growing passion to apply my strong analytical skills to coding.

 I started from attending **Graphic Design and Web Development course in Open Design School**; then I went through **significant amount of online courses and worked on misc websites for my friends**. The last but not the least was my decision to commit to **Makers Academy Immersive Web Development** course, where other than extensive real-life-like experience, I grasped thorough knowledge of the best practices and good taste for code.
